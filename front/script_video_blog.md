# Top 5 Web Extension

Hello World !

Today, I will show you my top 5 Web Extensions.

This is a list ranked by my personal usage.

Let's start !

## 5. uBlock Origin

We don't take a lot of time to talk about this extension. Basically, it's a blocker of ads and trackers. It's a must have for me.

## 4. Grepper

This extension is very usefull for every developer. Grepper is a community tool, when you search something on Google, the community of Greeper who already search the same thing will help you with an answer. Look at this example :

When I search "How to do a loop in javascript", I get this result :

But sometimes, even if that not a dev domain, you can have a humoristic or usefull answer. Look at this example :

When I search "OneDrive", I get these answers of Greeper :

## 3. I don't care about cookies

This extension is very nice when you don't care about cookies, yep, that the name. In Europe, when we go on a website in legislation with the GDPR, we need to choice between accept or refuse the cookies. That SOOO annoying. With this extension, you can accept all cookies without any popup.

(Show example here)

## 2. SponsoreBlock

This extension is a game changer. When you go on Youtube Video, you don't want to watch the sponsor of NordVPN, Raid Shadow Legend, or other sponsor ans The youtuber who say "Like, Share and Subscribe" is also annoying. With this extension, you can choice what you want to watch.

So, this extension skip sponsor, autopromotion, and other things you don't want to watch. You can also skip the intro or outro of the video.

## 1. The first one is ... (drum roll) TamperMonkey

Because of all of "illegal" extensions are not accepted on the Chrome Web Store, or just because the developer don't want to publish it, we need to use TamperMonkey. This extension is a script manager. You can install script from the TamperMonkey website, or you can create your own script. I will show you some script I installed :

- Twitch Ad Fix : Remove all ads on Twitch
- Twitch VOD Unblocker : Remove the sub to watch VOD
- Youtube Genius Lyrics : Show the lyrics of the song you are listening on Youtube

## Conclusion

That's all for today, I hope you enjoyed this video. If you have any question, don't hesitate to ask me in the comment section. See you next time !

Goodbye !
